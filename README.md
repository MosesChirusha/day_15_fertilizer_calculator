# Fertilizer Calculator (Day 15)

Offline-first fertilizer recommendation tool designed to help smallholder
farmers estimate fertilizer quantities based on crop type, land size, and
fertilizer type.

Built as part of a 90-day challenge to create practical digital solutions for
everyday problems in Africa.

---

## Problem
Many farmers apply fertilizer using guesswork due to lack of accessible
recommendations. Over-application increases costs and degrades soil, while
under-application reduces crop yields. Existing guidance is often technical,
inaccessible, or unavailable at planting time.

---

## Solution
A simple browser-based fertilizer calculator that:
- Estimates fertilizer quantities using common crop and fertilizer types
- Converts recommendations into kilograms per acre
- Works fully offline
- Requires no registration or data collection

The tool prioritizes clarity and usability over agronomic precision.
